The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the supermarketâ€™s sales performance by examining key metrics such as product line quantity sold, branch-specific sales, payment methods, gender-based sales, city-wise sales, total quantity sold, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), total profits, and overall sales. Additionally, an interactive slicer was implemented to enable dynamic exploration of the data, allowing users to filter the quantity sold by product line, date, branch, and payment method. These insights will empower the supermarket to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, cost efficiency, and the discovery of new revenue streams.",
